Description:
On a cold valentine night, I was trying to compensate our night out by watching this fine romantic movie home. I have this SSTV channel that needs a decoder to be able to watch it. Can you help out?

Solution:

We try different decoders of SSTV (Slow Scan Television) -- they are not a lot; And we find that the channel in question was using the Robot 36 decoder. Which is the most famous.
